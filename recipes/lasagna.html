    <p>This is a traditional dish in my family. Anyone can make it really. It is composed of traditional Mexican ingredients layered over the top of one another in a lasagna-like fashion (hence the name) but has little similarity to lasagna, so lasagna haters have no fear!</p>
    <h2>Ingredient</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>½ cup butter</li>
        <li>1 cup sugar</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground cloves</li>
        <li>2 apples - peeled, cored and chopped</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Step 1</li>
        <p>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease an 8x4 inch loaf pan.</p>
        <li>Step 2</li>
        <p>In a bowl, mix the butter and sugar until smooth and creamy. Beat in the eggs.

        </p>
        <li>Step 3</li>
        <p>In a separate bowl, sift together the flour, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, and cloves. Mix into the butter mixture until moistened. Fold in the apples. Transfer to the prepared loaf pan.</p>
        <li>Step 4</li>
        <p>Bake 1 hour in the preheated oven, until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Cool in the pan for 15 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.</p>
    </ul>
